        <p>The US Government has turned the Internet into something it was never intended to be: a system for spying on us in our most private moments. By tapping Internet cables, undermining security standards, and getting our data from companies in secret, the National Security Agency has built the largest surveillance apparatus in history and is collecting information on most Internet users.</p>

        <p>Ad agencies mine info on our individual vulnerabilities to coerce consumer and political decisions, without our knowledge. Companies leak out our financial information, violate their own privacy agreements and still are offered immunity for sharing our customer data with the NSA. The government and police use counterterrorism resources to spy on our peaceful political protests. People get longer jail time depending on the zip code they live in, even for the same offense. And just imagine what else is happening without our knowledge.</p>

<p>The Internet is integrated into every part of our lives—what we allow to happen with our data will shape the future of our society. We're now on the brink of making big decisions about the kinds of power governments and monopolies have to use this data against our own interests. And, they're moving fast—the US, Britain, France, Singapore, Iran, China, and more, are all moving to pass expansive surveillance laws and sweetening deals for cooperating tech companies (like with full corporate immunity from our laws). We have to draw the line in the sand now.</p>

        <p>Companies are rated based on their roles in supporting or opposing legislative
policies addressing warrantless surveillance of Internet communications and data
insecurity. Companies that support the position that would limit surveillance
and data insecurity on allthree bills are included on “Team Internet.” Companies
that support the position that furthers surveillance and data insecurity on an
of the bills are on “Team NSA.” <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sIBDvYEaJm4-NoEwOxUu4vAR4C-VTPzAR4O079pspQ4/pubhtml">Sources and raw data are here.</a></p>

<p>Because positions can change, the most recent statement from a company (or a
trade group representing them) is used to determine their position. Statements
can take the form of any legitimate company communication or action—blog posts,
letters to Congress, tweets, trade statements, or anything else. Trade
associations and coalitions are assumed to speak for all of their member
organizations. Statements from employees and CEOs, unless specifically stated as
the company, will not be considered for this because they do not necessarily
reflect the corporate position.</p>

<p>Companies that have made their own statement on CISA, separate from their trade
groups, are listed higher up in rankings and recognized with a special star
next to their name. Companies that have no known position are considered
“silent” and categorized with Team NSA.</p>

<p>This scorecard looks at the top tech, software, Internet, and telecom companies
by valuation, revenue, and Internet ranking. It also includes other companies
that have made efforts to have stances on these three policies.</p>

<p>This scorecard is a joint project of <a href="https://restorethe4th.com">Restore The
Fourth</a> and <a href="https://fightforthefuture.org">Fight for the
Future</a>.</p>

<p>The scorecard is objective, rather than qualitative. That is, scores are based
on actual votes and legislative action such as co-sponsorships rather
than the quality or trustworthiness of legislators' public action or
statements on mass
surveillance.</p>

<ul>
<li>Version 1.0 of this Scorecard was EFF’s <a href="https://standagainstspying.org">Stand Against Spying</a></li>
<li>Version 2.0 launched September 29, 2015, and scored Congressional votes on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 and FISA reform bills not included in v. 1.0.</li>
<li>Version 2.1 launched October 29, 2015, and added Congressional votes on cybersecurity bills (CISA, PCNA and NCPAA) and ECPA reform.</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Summary of Points Allocations and Grade Boundaries</strong></h4>

<p>As further relevant votes come up, they will be added to the points system.</p>

<h5>113th Congress (2013-14):</h5>

<p>Sponsored or cosponsored S. 1551, IOSRA (Yes=+4)
Sponsored or cosponsored FISA Improvements Act (Yes=-4)

Before this date, USA FREEDOM was a substantially stronger piece
of legislation, meriting +2 rather than +1.
Voted for Conyers/Amash amendment (Yes=+4)
Voted for House version of USA FREEDOM 2014 (Yes=-2) This gutted
version of USA FREEDOM was weaker than what eventually passed in the
114th Congress, meriting -2 points.
Voted for Massie-Lofgren amendment 2014 (Yes = +3)</p>

<h5>114th Congress (2015-16):</h5>

<p>Sponsored or cosponsored whistleblower protection for IC
employees/contractors (Yes=+4)
1st USA FREEDOM 2015 cloture vote (Yes=+1, No=+4 or =-4
conditional on straight reauth vote)
Straight reauth (Yes=-3)
Sponsored or cosponsored FISA Reform Act (Yes=-3)
Amendment 1449 to USA FREEDOM 2015: Data retention (No=+1, Yes=-3)
Amendment 1450 to USA FREEDOM 2015: Extend implementation to 1yr (No=+1, Yes=-2)
Amendment 1451 to USA FREEDOM 2015: Gut amicus (No=+1, Yes=-3)
Final passage USA FREEDOM 2015 (Yes=+1, No=+4 or =-4
conditional on straight reauth vote)
House vote on PCNA (Yes=-3, No=+3)
House vote on NCPAA (Yes=-2, No=+2)
Massie-Lofgren amendment to HR2685: Defund 702 (Yes=+3/No=-3)
Massie-Lofgren amendment on HR4870: No Encryption Backdoors (Yes=+3/No=-3)
Senate vote for cloture on CISA (Yes=-4, No=+4)
Senate vote on Franken amendment to CISA (narrowing definition of
cybersecurity threat) (Yes=+2/No=-1)
Senate vote on Wyden amendment to CISA (companies must scrub
personal data) (Yes=+2/No=-1)
Senate vote on Heller amendment to CISA (DHS must scrub personal
data) (Yes=+1/No=-1)
Senate vote on Coons amendment to CISA (limit information sharing to
that necessary to describe or identify a cybersecurity threat) (Yes=+1/No=-1)
Senate vote on Cotton amendment (removes liability for bypassing DHS
to share data with FBI and Secret Service) (Yes=-2/No=+1)
Cosponsored ECPA reform bill in 114th Congress (Yes=+2)
Sponsored or cosponsored bill proposing Section 702 reforms in 114th
Congress (Yes=+4)</p>

<p>We set the grade boundaries unevenly, because the legislators are
themselves distributed unevenly. The buckets are generally narrower in
the middle of the distribution than at either end.</p>

<h3>Methodological Issues in Allocating Points</h3>

<p>Two notable difficulties that arose when formulating the scorecard
were how to interpret votes on the USA FREEDOM Act, and how to score
amendments.</p>

<p>USA FREEDOM 2015 votes were not a clear signal of being for or
against surveillance reform. The USA FREEDOM Act changed the process of surveillance by separating surveillance procedures but many organizations and legislators warned that it preserves and modernizes the same surveillance authorities, while enabling Congress to say it tackled surveillance reform. Therefore, Yes votes are graded at -1. However, because of the nature of the bill, a No vote could mean 1. that the legislator thought the USA FREEDOM Act didn't go nearly far enough or 2. that even very weak reforms are unacceptable there shouldn't be any restrictions of surveillance authorities. Therefore No votes in the Senate were tied to the legislator’s vote on whether to do "straight reauthorization" of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. A Yes on straight reauthorization indicated clearly that they wanted no surveillance reform whatsoever, and therefore that if they then voted No on the USA FREEDOM Act, it
was because they believed it went too far. Conversely, a Senator
voting No on straight reauthorization and then No on the USA FREEDOM
Act likely felt that the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak. For the
former group, we coded a No vote on USA FREEDOM as -4 points; for the
latter group, we coded the same vote as +4 points. In the House, we
went back to EFF's "Stand Against Spying" scorecard and analyzed the
grades of the 88 House members voting against the USA FREEDOM Act, and
found that in almost all cases their grades on that prior scorecard
were very high. Consequently, all House No votes on USA FREEDOM were coded as +4. For prior votes on the 2014 version of USA FREEDOM, we adopted EFF's approach, and scored the version before it was gutted at +2 and the version after it was gutted at -2.</p>

<p>Scoring amendments to CISA posed complexities. CISA
went beyond cybersecurity policies and is a surveillance bill. Many amendments were offered, and that raised the problem that legislators might vote for CISA on cloture (-4) and on final passage (-4), but might vote in favor of all
anti-surveillance amendments, and thereby come out ahead on net. We
dealt with this by not scoring the Leahy amendment (relating to FOIA
exemptions) and by allocating points such that a legislator like this
would come out slightly behind on points.</p>

<h4>Reporting Accurately on Surveillance Reform</h4>

<p>This project threw up several important findings relevant to journalists
reporting on surveillance, and to members of the public deciding how to vote and
whom to fund.</p>

<p>First, and most importantly, party affiliation is not a guide to your
legislator's stance on mass surveillance. We find a few Democrats with Fs and
many Republicans with A+. So while not entirely useless, party affiliation is
highly unreliable, and journalists should steer clear of identifying a
party-based stance on surveillance in their reporting.</p>

<p>Second, reporters should not treat the reforms in the USA FREEDOM Act as being
the most radical reform measures in Congress. The scorecard includes many
examples of stronger reforms that have garnered substantial support. As we move
forward into discussions of reforms to the much more abusive Section 702 of the
FISA Amendments Act, which sunsets in June 2017, it will be worth bearing in
mind the substantial, bipartisan set of legislators who never intended reform
efforts to stop with the passage of the USA FREEDOM Act.</p>

<p>Third, the data does provide some guidance as to who in Congress is more likely
to support reform. There is also usually substantial variation within states
that argues against easy conclusions. In key 2016 races around the country, the
candidates running from both parties have sharply different positions on
surveillance, and we have no reason to suppose that this will change in future
cycles.</p>

            <h3>Our Scoring System </h3>

            <p>This project originated in a desire to update EFF's
                <a href="https://standagainstspying.org/">"Stand Against
                    Spying"</a> scorecard covering legislative activity in the
                113th Congress (2013-14), to take into account votes taken in
                the legislative battle over Section 215 renewal and the USA
                FREEDOM Act, which provided limited reforms of Section 215. It
                is a joint project of Restore The Fourth and Fight for the
                Future, with the key participants being Alex Marthews and Zaki
                Manian of Restore The Fourth and Tiffiniy Cheng and Jeff Lyon of
                Fight for the Future.
            </p>

            <p>
                We decided early on that, like with "Stand Against Spying", the
                scorecard should be objective: That is, it should not contain
                value judgments about the quality or trustworthiness of
                legislators' public statements on mass surveillance, or about
                how the legislator was generally perceived to stand on that
                issue, but should consider only the votes they actually took,
                and decisions to sponsor or cosponsor legislation introduced in
                Congress. This important limitation means that, for example,
                House Majority Leader John Boehner, who has a general practice
                of not voting on bills unless he has to to break a tie, does not
                have a score in our scorecard and is therefore graded at "?",
                despite voluminous press reports suggesting that he is generally
                opposed to surveillance reform; and that Curtis Clawson (R-FL)
                and Ruben Hinojosa (D-FL), whose voting records are too sparse
                on this topic to enable a clear judgement to be made, are also
                graded at ?.
            </p>

            <p>The major challenge for a surveillance scorecard is interpreting
                votes on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. Being against this Act was
                not a clear signal of being for or against surveillance reform.
                For many organizations, including ours, and for many legislators
                as well, the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak and limited to
                represent any kind of surveillance reform, and also modernized
                certain powers of the surveillance state. Its passage even posed
                a risk of derailing real surveillance reform by enabling
                legislators to make the political claim that it had dealt with
                the problem of mass surveillance. A Yes vote on the USA FREEDOM
                Act could therefore potentially mean that the legislator thought
                that it was a good, if incremental, step towards reform; but it
                could also, as it turned it for some legislators, be thought of
                as the most feasible way to preserve surveillance authorities
                against the threat of the outright expiration of Section 215. A
                No vote could mean that the legislator thought the USA FREEDOM
                Act didn't go nearly far enough; but it could also mean that the
                legislator could not accept even its very weak reforms, and felt
                that Congress should not restrict surveillance authorities at
                all.
            </p>

            <p>In consequence, we needed some objective indicator of a
                legislator's underlying desire for surveillance reform, in order
                to assign points correctly to their votes on the USA FREEDOM
                Act. For the Senate, we found an indicator, in the form of the
                Senate's vote on whether to do "straight reauthorization" of
                Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. If a Senator voted Yes on
                straight reauthorization, that was a much clearer indicator that
                they wanted no surveillance reform whatsoever, and therefore
                that if they then voted No on the USA FREEDOM Act, it was
                because they believed it went too far. Conversely, a Senator
                voting No on straight reauthorization and then No on the USA
                FREEDOM Act likely felt that the USA FREEDOM Act was far too
                weak. For the former group, we coded a No vote on USA FREEDOM as
                -4 points; for the latter group, we coded the same vote as +4
                points. In the House, we went back to EFF's "Stand Against
                Spying" scorecard and analyzed the grades of the 88 House
                members voting against the USA FREEDOM Act, and found that in
                almost all cases their grades on that prior scorecard were very
                high. Consequently, we felt comfortable coding all House No
                votes on USA FREEDOM as +4. After much discussion, we felt that
                most legislators voting Yes on USA FREEDOM in either chamber
                probably voted Yes because they felt it was a positive step
                towards reform, so we coded such votes as +1.
            </p>

            <p>For the prior votes on the 2014 version of USA FREEDOM, we
                adopted EFF's approach, and scored the version before it was
                gutted at +2 and the version after it was gutted at -2.
            </p>

            <p>The rest of the coding was relatively straightforward. Voting for
                or cosponsoring measures that advanced surveillance reform
                gained points for the legislator; voting against such measures,
                or cosponsoring anti-reform measures, lost points for the
                legislator. The number of points gained or lost represents our
                collective value judgement as to how much the measure, if
                passed, would advance the overall project of surveillance
                reform. For example, the wholesale repeal of the surveillance
                state represented by the Surveillance State Repeal Acts of 2014
                and 2015 merit four points each; the FISA Reform Act of 2015,
                briefly introduced as an attempt to provide a weaker substitute
                for the USA FREEDOM Act, merits -3 points.
            </p>

            <p>Summary of Points Allocation</p>

            <p> As further relevant votes come up, such as those on CISA, we
                will add them to our points system. At the beginning of the
                116th Congress, we intend to remove the point allocations for
                the 113th Congress, to keep the scorecard relevant to
                legislators' recent activity.

            <p>Implications of the Scorecard</p>

            <p>This project threw up several important findings relevant to
                journalists reporting on surveillance, and to members of the
                public deciding how to vote and whom to fund.</p>

            <p>First, and most importantly, party affiliation is not a guide to
                your legislator's stance on mass surveillance. Unlike for almost
                any other issue, both support for and opposition to surveillance
                reform crosses party lines. Strongly liberal legislators usually
                get A+ (as with Rep. Barbara Lee or Sen. Bernie Sanders) or As,
                but Charlie Rangel gets only a B+, and there are two Democrats,
                Jim Langevin of Rhode Island and Terri Sewell of Alabama, who
                get Fs. While strongly conservative legislators do most often
                get Ds and Fs, there are conservatives not closely identified in
                public with the surveillance reform fight, like Louie Gohmert of
                Texas and Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, who get A+. So while
                not entirely useless, party affiliation is highly unreliable,
                and journalists should steer clear of identifying a party-based
                stance on surveillance in their reporting.</p>

            <p>What does play a role? </p>

            <p>Several tendencies seem apparent, but are not a given.
                African-American legislators are systematically more likely to
                support surveillance reform. Legislators with a military
                background, or service on an intelligence committee, are
                systematically less likely to support surveillance reform.
                Legislators who identify with the Ron Paul movement, such as
                Reps. Massie and Amash and (of course) Sen. Rand Paul, tend
                strongly to support surveillance reform, and are a vocal and
                passionate minority of Republican legislators. More recently
                elected legislators of both parties tend to be more supportive
                of surveillance reform, probably because they have run first for
                their office during a period when the issue was especially
                salient. Legislators in leadership, and particularly on the
                Armed Services or Intelligence Committees, are more likely to
                oppose surveillance reform. Southern legislators are generally
                more opposed to surveillance reform - no Arkansas legislator
                rates above a D, and if an F- had been available, Sen. Tom
                Cotton (R-AR) would have been the only legislator with one.
                Pacific Northwest, Upper Midwest and Northeastern legislators
                are generally more favorable to surveillance reform - no Vermont
                legislator rates below an A. However, considerable variation
                within states is the norm, even in smaller states like Idaho and
                Iowa.</p>

            <p>We can see, therefore, that in key 2016 races around the country,
                the candidates running from both parties have sharply different
                positions on surveillance, and we have no reason to suppose that
                this will change in future cycles.</p>

            <h3>Our Scoring System </h3>

            <p>This project originated in a desire to update EFF's
                <a href="https://standagainstspying.org/">"Stand Against
                    Spying"</a> scorecard covering legislative activity in the
                113th Congress (2013-14), to take into account votes taken in
                the legislative battle over Section 215 renewal and the USA
                FREEDOM Act, which provided limited reforms of Section 215. It
                is a joint project of Restore The Fourth and Fight for the
                Future, with the key participants being Alex Marthews and Zaki
                Manian of Restore The Fourth and Tiffiniy Cheng and Jeff Lyon of
                Fight for the Future.
            </p>

            <p>
                We decided early on that, like with "Stand Against Spying", the
                scorecard should be objective: That is, it should not contain
                value judgments about the quality or trustworthiness of
                legislators' public statements on mass surveillance, or about
                how the legislator was generally perceived to stand on that
                issue, but should consider only the votes they actually took,
                and decisions to sponsor or cosponsor legislation introduced in
                Congress. This important limitation means that, for example,
                House Majority Leader John Boehner, who has a general practice
                of not voting on bills unless he has to to break a tie, does not
                have a score in our scorecard and is therefore graded at "?",
                despite voluminous press reports suggesting that he is generally
                opposed to surveillance reform; and that Curtis Clawson (R-FL)
                and Ruben Hinojosa (D-FL), whose voting records are too sparse
                on this topic to enable a clear judgement to be made, are also
                graded at ?.
            </p>

            <p>The major challenge for a surveillance scorecard is interpreting
                votes on the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. Being against this Act was
                not a clear signal of being for or against surveillance reform.
                For many organizations, including ours, and for many legislators
                as well, the USA FREEDOM Act was far too weak and limited to
                represent any kind of surveillance reform, and also modernized
                certain powers of the surveillance state. Its passage even posed
                a risk of derailing real surveillance reform by enabling
                legislators to make the political claim that it had dealt with
                the problem of mass surveillance. A Yes vote on the USA FREEDOM
                Act could therefore potentially mean that the legislator thought
                that it was a good, if incremental, step towards reform; but it
                could also, as it turned it for some legislators, be thought of
                as the most feasible way to preserve surveillance authorities
                against the threat of the outright expiration of Section 215. A
                No vote could mean that the legislator thought the USA FREEDOM
                Act didn't go nearly far enough; but it could also mean that the
                legislator could not accept even its very weak reforms, and felt
                that Congress should not restrict surveillance authorities at
                all.
            </p>

            <p>In consequence, we needed some objective indicator of a
                legislator's underlying desire for surveillance reform, in order
                to assign points correctly to their votes on the USA FREEDOM
                Act. For the Senate, we found an indicator, in the form of the
                Senate's vote on whether to do "straight reauthorization" of
                Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. If a Senator voted Yes on
                straight reauthorization, that was a much clearer indicator that
                they wanted no surveillance reform whatsoever, and therefore
                that if they then voted No on the USA FREEDOM Act, it was
                because they believed it went too far. Conversely, a Senator
                voting No on straight reauthorization and then No on the USA
                FREEDOM Act likely felt that the USA FREEDOM Act was far too
                weak. For the former group, we coded a No vote on USA FREEDOM as
                -4 points; for the latter group, we coded the same vote as +4
                points. In the House, we went back to EFF's "Stand Against
                Spying" scorecard and analyzed the grades of the 88 House
                members voting against the USA FREEDOM Act, and found that in
                almost all cases their grades on that prior scorecard were very
                high. Consequently, we felt comfortable coding all House No
                votes on USA FREEDOM as +4. After much discussion, we felt that
                most legislators voting Yes on USA FREEDOM in either chamber
                probably voted Yes because they felt it was a positive step
                towards reform, so we coded such votes as +1.
            </p>

            <p>For the prior votes on the 2014 version of USA FREEDOM, we
                adopted EFF's approach, and scored the version before it was
                gutted at +2 and the version after it was gutted at -2.
            </p>

            <p>The rest of the coding was relatively straightforward. Voting for
                or cosponsoring measures that advanced surveillance reform
                gained points for the legislator; voting against such measures,
                or cosponsoring anti-reform measures, lost points for the
                legislator. The number of points gained or lost represents our
                collective value judgement as to how much the measure, if
                passed, would advance the overall project of surveillance
                reform. For example, the wholesale repeal of the surveillance
                state represented by the Surveillance State Repeal Acts of 2014
                and 2015 merit four points each; the FISA Reform Act of 2015,
                briefly introduced as an attempt to provide a weaker substitute
                for the USA FREEDOM Act, merits -3 points.
            </p>

            <p>Summary of Points Allocation</p>

            <p> As further relevant votes come up, such as those on CISA, we
                will add them to our points system. At the beginning of the
                116th Congress, we intend to remove the point allocations for

            <p>Implications of the Scorecard</p>

            <p>This project threw up several important findings relevant to
                journalists reporting on surveillance, and to members of the
                public deciding how to vote and whom to fund.</p>

            <p>First, and most importantly, party affiliation is not a guide to
                your legislator's stance on mass surveillance. Unlike for almost
                any other issue, both support for and opposition to surveillance
                reform crosses party lines. Strongly liberal legislators usually
                get A+ (as with Rep. Barbara Lee or Sen. Bernie Sanders) or As,
                but Charlie Rangel gets only a B+, and there are two Democrats,
                Jim Langevin of Rhode Island and Terri Sewell of Alabama, who
                get Fs. While strongly conservative legislators do most often
                get Ds and Fs, there are conservatives not closely identified in
                public with the surveillance reform fight, like Louie Gohmert of
                Texas and Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, who get A+. So while
                not entirely useless, party affiliation is highly unreliable,
                and journalists should steer clear of identifying a party-based
                stance on surveillance in their reporting.</p>

            <p>What does play a role? </p>

            <p>Several tendencies seem apparent, but are not a given.
                African-American legislators are systematically more likely to
                support surveillance reform. Legislators with a military
                background, or service on an intelligence committee, are
                systematically less likely to support surveillance reform.
                Legislators who identify with the Ron Paul movement, such as
                Reps. Massie and Amash and (of course) Sen. Rand Paul, tend
                strongly to support surveillance reform, and are a vocal and
                passionate minority of Republican legislators. More recently
                elected legislators of both parties tend to be more supportive
                of surveillance reform, probably because they have run first for
                their office during a period when the issue was especially
                salient. Legislators in leadership, and particularly on the
                Armed Services or Intelligence Committees, are more likely to
                oppose surveillance reform. Southern legislators are generally
                more opposed to surveillance reform - no Arkansas legislator
                rates above a D, and if an F- had been available, Sen. Tom
                Cotton (R-AR) would have been the only legislator with one.
                Pacific Northwest, Upper Midwest and Northeastern legislators
                are generally more favorable to surveillance reform - no Vermont
                legislator rates below an A. However, considerable variation
                within states is the norm, even in smaller states like Idaho and
                Iowa.</p>

            <p>We can see, therefore, that in key 2016 races around the country,
                the candidates running from both parties have sharply different
                positions on surveillance, and we have no reason to suppose that
                this will change in future cycles.</p>
