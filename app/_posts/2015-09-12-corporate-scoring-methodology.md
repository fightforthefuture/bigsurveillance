**Scorecard Methodology**

Companies are rated based on their roles in supporting or opposing legislative
policies addressing warrantless surveillance of Internet communications and data
insecurity. Companies that support the position that would limit surveillance
and data insecurity on allthree bills are included on “Team Internet.” Companies
that support the position that furthers surveillance and data insecurity on an
of the bills are on “Team NSA.” [Sources and raw data are here.][01]

Because positions can change, the most recent statement from a company (or a
trade group representing them) is used to determine their position. Statements
can take the form of any legitimate company communication or action—blog posts,
letters to Congress, tweets, trade statements, or anything else. Trade
associations and coalitions are assumed to speak for all of their member
organizations. Statements from employees and CEOs, unless specifically stated as
the company, will not be considered for this because they do not necessarily
reflect the corporate position.

Companies that have made their own statement on CISA, separate from their trade
groups, are listed higher up in rankings and recognized with a special star
next to their name. Companies that have no known position are considered
“silent” and categorized with Team NSA.

This scorecard looks at the top tech, software, Internet, and telecom companies
by valuation, revenue, and Internet ranking. It also includes other companies
that have made efforts to have stances on these three policies.
